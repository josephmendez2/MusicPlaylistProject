# MusicPlaylistProject

This is the README.

This project was created in my senior year of College. I'm really proud of how this turned out.

Basically, this is a custom made playlist created in 2019 that plays my top favorite songs of that year.

Simply press play on the buttons or skip to play the next song. It's got a similar style to spotify's layout.

On the top left of the playlist will be a music note icon, click on that to see all the songs and select each songs
from the dropdown menu.
